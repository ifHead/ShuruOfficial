# Typing Effect Library

> An open-source Typing-effect Library I created. That enables potential users to add a typing effect to mere DOM Elements.

## How To Use
Below is a brief tutorial on how to use this Tool.
- [x] To Begin a new typing effect Initialize the class as follows
```javascript
import Typed from "./typed.js";

const newText = new Typed()
```
---
- [x] The First Parameter should be the selector of the text element ( In my case a span with a class of `auto-text` ).
**Note:** Elements are selected with the `querySelector` method.
```javascript
const newText = new Typed('.auto-text')
```
---
- [x] The Second Parameter is an object that takes in five Key-Value pairs (one mandatory, four optional) as shown below.
```javascript
  {
     // Mandatory. array of strings to be typed
    strings: [],
     // typing-in speed. default value is one
    typeSpeed: number,
     // typing-out speed. default value is one
    backSpeed: number,
     // occur once or forever. default value is false
    loop: boolean,
     // color of insertion point. default value is black
    IPColor: string,
  }
```
Your code should look similar to below
```javascript
const newText = new Typed('.auto-text', {
  strings: [
    'first string',
    'second string',
  ]
}
```
